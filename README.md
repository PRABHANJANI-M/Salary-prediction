# 📘 Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
🔍 Overview

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on multiple features such as Age, Gender, Education Level, and Years of Experience.
Using Linear Regression, the model identifies how each of these factors influences salary and estimates the expected salary for new employees.

The analysis provides valuable insights into how education and experience affect income, supporting better decision-making in recruitment and compensation planning.

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Programming language used for data analysis and modeling

Pandas – For data handling and preprocessing

NumPy – For numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization

Scikit-learn – For building and evaluating the machine learning model

Sympy – For mathematical analysis and formula representation (optional)

# 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains employee details and salary information.
Each record represents one employee with the following fields:

Age – Employee’s age

Gender – Encoded numerically (e.g., 0 = Female, 1 = Male)

Education Level – Numeric representation of education qualification

Years of Experience – Total years of professional experience

Salary – Annual salary in currency units

The dataset is clean, simple, and ideal for supervised learning.

# 🧠 Project Workflow

Data Loading:
The dataset is imported and inspected for structure and missing values.

Data Cleaning:
Missing or inconsistent values are handled, and data types are standardized.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summaries are generated.

Relationships between variables are explored through graphs.

Correlation between features is visualized using a heatmap.

Model Building:
A Linear Regression model is trained using features like Age, Education Level, and Experience to predict Salary.

Model Evaluation:
The model is tested using various evaluation metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score (explains how well the model fits the data)

# Visualization:
Graphs are plotted to compare actual and predicted salaries, and to visualize trends like Salary vs Years of Experience or Salary vs Education Level.

📊 Insights & Results

Salary increases consistently with Years of Experience and Education Level.

Age shows a moderate positive correlation with Salary.

The model achieves a high R² Score, indicating strong predictive accuracy.

Visualization confirms a near-linear relationship between experience and salary.

# 🚀 Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

How to preprocess and analyze real-world salary data.

How linear regression can be applied to predict continuous values.

The impact of different employee factors on salary levels.

# 💡 Future Enhancements

Add more features such as Job Role, Location, or Industry Type.

Implement Polynomial Regression or Decision Trees for better accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
